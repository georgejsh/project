\hspace{10mm}In Sub-Graph Isomorphism we are trying to find whether a sub-graph of Data Graph is isomorphic to the query graph. Sub-Graph Isomorphism is a NP-Hard problem. Because of the lots of applications of the problem in many Data mining and pattern matching, the problem is well studied and different methods are proposed in the past years. We studied many of the state-of-art techniques used to solve the problem. Then parallelised one of them in GPU. We then tried to solve the dynamic version of the problem. In the dynamic version we remove or add edges on the go and we would like to get the output on the current problem.
